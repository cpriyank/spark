<p>[Time: January 13, 2011, between 3 to 4 pm]</p>
<p>[Back and forth on the pavement between D Block and K Block, Nirma University]</p>
<p>It was rather cold for a January afternoon in Amdavad even as the grass bathed in radiant sunlight; the wind had wishes of its own: yanking clothes of the passersby like an unrelenting paramour in one moment, caressing with a breeze in the next.</p>
<p>“Are you confident enough?” enquired Lars, almost rhetorically. He had solemn demeanor cast to every cell of his face today, and seemed not at all the man who would make silly eunuch jokes of everyone almost all the time. He had removed his frivolous face, Pie thought, and donned the solemn face of a 50-something Ratan Tata. Changeless, like a universal constant.</p>
<p>“Repeating eleventy first time, I’ll handle it somehow, as I always have.” retorted Pie, cutting Lars short.</p>
<p>As an introvert, Pie was used to anticipating every kind of scenario, while still keeping a room for surprise by his own actions out of intuition. By design he was never sure of anything if it involved talking to someone; yet he felt surprisingly confident. He wondered if Lars had been playing a clever manager trick on him.</p>
<p>Proposing to someone else’s girlfriend was always a terrible idea. Helping Lars was one thing, but proposing to Vida for Lars was a heresy, he urged Lars once again: “Every other way is better than this. Have some patience, build some courage, stand up on your own and she’ll not deny it.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been through this already. There’s no other way. I am out of patience. She must know today. It’s okay if she denies. If she doesn’t deny, I’ll propose to her again afterwards” Lars turned into a child again.</p>
<p>“Well, you can read a proposal song involving moments you had with her from my mobile. You don’t have to look at her.” Like Batman, there was no such thing as an unprepared Pie in those days.</p>
<p>“Forget the song. Don’t be a wimp now, “F%##@&#x26;^¢“. You said you’re going to do it and you’ll do it”, fulminated Lars.</p>
<p>“Let go of your ego; it is preventing you from facing a possibilities you’re not prepared for; let it go and you won’t need me to do it for you.” Pie was used to unleashing the ‘ego’ weapon whenever someone disagreed with him. It always worked with the logical ones.</p>
<p>“Meh. Try another weapon. You said even Sophie and all her 7 hostel mates said it was a good idea. We have 8 votes against your 1” Lars shrugged it off. He was Pie’s alter-ego, after all.</p>
<p>“1. She didn’t say that they thought it was a good idea, they said it was a ‘not a bad’ idea. 2. It’s her exam season and they’ve been prescribing each other zolpidem or worse, so their judgement might very well be clouded.”</p>
<p>Pie knew Lars will not budge. But he had to try. <em>It will not be much longer</em>, he had taken to telling himself.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Right” declared Lars. He was deaf to anything he didn’t want to listen to today.</p>
<p>For almost a week now, Pie had been preparing for this and celebrating for his best buddy in anticipation. He liked to think about the prospects, whatever resulted today. At the very least, he would be absolved from Lars’s henpecking.</p>
<p>“So do you want to rehearse?” decreed Lars.</p>
<p>“I think you’ve seen enough examples of the persistence of my memory; which is sometimes a boon, more often a bane.” Pie almost muttered the last sentence to himself.</p>
<p>“Still, I think we should go through it one more time.” Repeating the lines seemed like a small price to pay than arguing with Lars further.</p>
<p>Pie acquiesced: “Fine. Here’s how it should happen: You’ll go far away to order ice cream. I’ll begin by asking her favorite SRK’s favorite movie. She probably thinks of me to be someone who has one or more screws loose; I have had to appear that way, every wingman has to; but she seems nice so she’ll at least answer, if not discuss it further. I’ve assumed that she wouldn’t pick unromantic ones like ‘Chak de India’, ‘King Uncle’, ‘Darr’ or, emmm, ‘Devdas’- that’s what you’ll soon turn into, if you go on this way after a probable rejection.</p>
<p>In fact I can only find a cue if she picks the ones in which SRK plays Raj or Rahul. Once I’ve brought some of your supposedly romantic thoughts on her mind, I’ll ask what her ideal soulmate would be like, what qualities he would have. She’ll probably think it’s a weird question and that the conversation is becoming more weird every moment; but given my uncanny reputation on her mind, she’ll think everything’s normal and nothing’s cooking.</p>
<p>Through a labyrinth of arguments and deliberate use of difficult-to-understand words, I’ll claim that some random guys from our batch are equipped with that ideal soulmate quality while making sure that I mention your name in passing <em>every single time</em>. I’ll ask when she first met you, and if she remembers that Jeep journey where you were co-passengers by chance, I’ll continue, otherwise I’ll put a break.</p>
<p>I’ll ask her if she feels anything for you. Regardless of her answer, I’ll blabber on and make it appear that I naturally happened to fall upon the topic of love. Then comes our difficult part.</p>
<p>I’ve had my monologue memorized but my face would likely give it away. I must maintain eye contact but there’s a risk that I may laugh out loud: Vida, when I was in 7th standard, I know it’s hard for you to imagine that given I’ve been called uncle since I was 10 but consider for a moment. When I was in 7th, my grandfather promised me that he’d buy me a “matches bat” if I topped my class. I was even madder cricket fan in 7th than I am today. Even the idea of having a “matches bat” was akin to how a devotee would feel if साक्षात् his favorite god appeared before him for a दर्शन assuming he or she exists. If I’d have a bat, my जन्म would be धन्य. I dreamed it in my sleep. I day-dreamed of it whenever my mind was idle. The idea of having a bat was my guiding force. I didn’t know if I understood what I studied, or what went on around, all I saw was that bat and the sound it would make when I would hit a “matches ball” from the sweet part of the bat. If you’ve been a fan of test cricket, you’d know there are fewer sounds as sweet. It’s not the sound when a batsman slogs, it’s the sound when the shot is exquisitely timed. There is hardly any effort from the batsman’s part. Think of Sachin’s straight drive, Dada’s cover drive, Laxman’s any shot down the leg, or Dravid’s square cut. The bat just kisses the ball gently and waves it goodbye. I get goosebumps every time I imagine the sound.</p>
<p>I still think this is too much cricket for a proposal. But it’ll keep her connected to what I’m talking about and make myself appear sincere.</p>
<p>I’ll continue thusly: I know Lars more than his roommates do. Ever since he personally met you in that Jeep journey to Amdavad, he’d dream of being with you and talking to you again just like I’d dreamed of the sweet part of the ‘matches bat’ sound. In my life, off the reel, I’ve never seen anyone so fervent about anyone else. He topped that semester, quite a difficult task in itself, given we’re the most bookish 120 people in Gujarat by score.</p>
<p>He scored 9.6 pointers, just because he thought it would buy him an opportunity to discuss something more with you, even if it were academics. And since your personal meetings started and you held his hand at PQR coffee shop, yes, he told me that, there’s nothing else in the world he can sense. You know he’ll support you in your every ambition and he’s good enough to have a future you have imagined. We’ve already established that he has every quality of your version of an ideal soulmate; and from the innumerable personal meetings you have had and things you have talked about, things you wouldn’t share with anyone else, and by the way he is sorry that he shared those things with me, it appears that you feel the same way about him.</p>
<p>I know I don’t understand people very well. I don’t understand life and relations very well. I’m not a smart person, <em>but I know what love is</em>. And he loves (I’ll whisper this word) you and you appear to love him too. So, without further verbiage, <em>dear Vida, will you marry Lars?</em></p>
<p>I will be my usual awkward self after that and let that sink in. I still think marriage is too early and valentine would be a better replacement here. Give me a cue if you change your mind. I don’t know how to suddenly change to that proposal look but I’ll try my best. I’ve practised and have received a thumbs up.</p>
<p>In the favourable but, unnnn, less likely event that she confesses what you have been praying for, I’ll stop and call you for some more ice cream. If she feels particularly scientific when I utter ‘love’, I’ll explain to her how you share all three aspects of love with her. Well, two and a half, at least.</p>
<p>If she thinks I’m kidding or have failed to understand you and your relationship, I’ll ask her to call Diti to confirm. She knows Diti can’t lie and will probably believe it. If she launches <em>but we’re just friends</em> missile, I’ll cite SRK <em>एक लड़का और एक लड़की कभी सिर्फ दोस्त नहीं हो सकते</em>  and give her a taste of her own medicine</p>
<p>If at any moment she tries to walk away thinking I’m a creep, and Sophie had warned me I might appear that way if I have wrong facial expressions as I usually have, I’ll play the song आना मेरे प्यार को ना तुम and you’ll appear before her and try to apologize with an ice cream. If you change your mind, I’ve brought रूक जा ओ दिल दीवाने as well.</p>
<p>If you can’t stop her as well, you can despair, and I’ll chug the ice cream you’ve ordered for her.</p>
<p>If she slaps me, gathers a crowd, or worse, unnnnnnnn, I’ll apologize. If no one’s willing to listen to my apology, I’ll run. If I’m caught and beaten, it’s okay, shouldn’t be a large crowd as probably we’re the only ones bunking, but you’ll pay for bandages and everything.</p>
<p>If they ask for my ID card, I haven’t brought my ID card and I don’t even study here, in fact I don’t know who I am.</p>
<p>If sakshaat Natalie Portman is in canteen, bossa nova baby! The world is too full to care about.”</p>
<p>Soon Vida comes up, alone as prayed, and the trio walks towards the canteen; it was almost empty as prayed; Lars and Pie spoke nothing, heard nothing what Vida  spoke about previous lecture in her class or what she complained, but shouted at each other with just facial expressions.</p>
<p>Pie had sworn a solemn vow not to utter a swearword, even in his mind; he broke that vow more than a hundred times that day.</p>
<p>As they began to settle down, Lars asked what each of them would have and said he’d have a Zulu bar.</p>
<p>“I’m cold. I’ll have some tea. If things are, ahem ahem, warm enough, I’ll have a cone after half an hour, thanks!” added Pie.</p>
<p>“I’ll have what you’re having.” Vida  grinned at Lars.</p>
<p><em>Was that a reference to <a href="https://youtu.be/lNEX0fbGePg">When Harry Met Sally</a>?</em> Pie wouldn’t know. He hardly understood what went on between Lars &#x26; Vida unless explicitly stated by Lars. Lars &#x26; Vida didn’t seem like the kind of people who’d watch that movie, though. But he wished that they would someday.</p>
<p>Lars started towards order canteen ordering counter, gasping one last time, indicating it was time, with that same ‘universal constant’ look.</p>
<p>And, Pie had an <em>idea</em>. He hadn’t considered this possibility before.</p>
<p>He knew he had to appear as if he’s executing his plan from distance, where Lars waited ever attentively, making a heap of his life’s winning, risking it on one turn of ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
<p>Instead of executing their carefully laid out plan, Pie started talking about FFT algorithm and then briefly talked about the movie Guzaarish, whose protagonist shared characteristics with Lars today.</p>
<p>“It’s done. You’re good to be here. I’ve told her. I’ve told her not to tell you what I told her. She is happy but she needs some time. She’ll act as if nothing happened until then. You can formally propose to her yourself when she’s ready. Come soon before my tea and your ice creams remind us of Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics again” Pie texted Lars.</p>
<p>From that day, Lars assumed Vida knew his feelings. He talked to her as if she’d already accepted the proposal. He’d probably proposed to her indirectly countlessly since then; making things a lot easier.</p>
<p>On January 24th, he finally realized he was fooled by Pie, that the Vicarious Proposal didn’t really happen. But it mattered very little since proposing to her wasn’t a mammoth task as it appeared on Jan 13th. Formal proposal never happened but ground was set up well by himself.</p>
<p>He still needed Pie and a part of his legendary monologue for formal proposal. Pie followed his orders this time out of contrition, though just a text to Vida was required this time, rather than playing an act.</p>
<p>Some happy love stories don’t involve “she said yes”, this one certainly didn’t.</p>
<p>On February 12th 2011, Lars &#x26; Vida  separately informed Pie about their union. And for the first time in so many years, Pie’s night came alive with the melody of the sweet part of the “matches bat” he’d always dreamed of.</p>
<p>To Lars &#x26; Vida, and their formal union I won’t be able to attend! May it last as long as anyone’s imagination can imagine!</p></div><ul class="sc-dlfnbm bcaJjD"><li><a rel="next" href="/spark/all-models-are-wrong/">All Models Are Wrong<!-- --> →</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="sc-gsTCUz bhdLno footer">© <!-- -->2021<!-- -->,<!-- --> <a href="https://cpriyank.github.io">cpriyank.github.io</a>.
