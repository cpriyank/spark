I find it difficult to charge friends or friends of friends for their photoshoots.

At the same time, I want to avoid being photographer-zoned. In addition to the time I spend doing a photoshoot, editing each picture usually takes 15-20 minutes. Also, when I don't charge, I get some gifts which are non-essential, except maybe when I pass those gifts to someone else. ü§∑

I feel this wish-list would offer a good solution to this predicament, while encouraging me to improve. 

To understand more about this rationale, read notes on social vs market norms from your favorite source or watch [this (easy to follow) small video by Prof. Dan Ariely](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cVwFZEW3z3g)

##  Photography

I have a [FE 85 mm F1.4 GM](https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel85f14gm) and a [FE 24-70 mm F2.8 GM](https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel2470gm/), but sometimes I borrow other lenses or cameras when I‚Äôm nit-picky.



Preferably from Crutchfield, Adorama, or B&H, in that order

##  DIY Electronics

- [Canakit Raspberry Pi 4 *8 GB* starter max kit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-max-kit.html)

I use it primarily as an ssh server for my home in India so that I can be the ‚ÄúIT Guy‚Äù for my parents and troubleshoot their devices. I currently have a laptop as an SSH server but would like to move to lighter setup.



I currently use Azure Blob Store to backup pictures with `rclone` but would like to move to something I can access easily from phone as well.

- Storage space for photos

[A 1TB NvMe SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1J3C23) + [an enclosure](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nvme+m.2+enclosure&ref=is_s)

One could consider an external NVMe SSD with thunderbolt such as [Samsung X5](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/x5/) but they are not the best value.

- 200 GB iCloud or Google Drive space for 3 years, as a reliable alternative to managing pictures in SSD.
