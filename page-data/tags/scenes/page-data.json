He had solemn demeanor cast to every cell of his face today, and seemed not at all the man who would make silly eunuch jokes of everyone almost all the time. He had removed his frivolous face, Pie thought, and donned the solemn face of a 50-something Ratan Tata. Changeless, like a universal constant. “Repeating eleventy first time, I’ll handle it somehow, as I always have.” retorted Pie, cutting Lars short. As an introvert, Pie was used to anticipating every kind of scenario, while still keeping a room for surprise by his own actions out of intuition. By design he was never sure of anything if it involved talking to someone; yet he felt surprisingly confident. He wondered if Lars had been playing a clever manager trick on him. Proposing to someone else’s girlfriend was always a terrible idea. Helping Lars was one thing, but proposing to Vida for Lars was a heresy, he urged Lars once again: “Every other way is better than this. Have some patience, build some courage, stand up on your own and she’ll not deny it.” “We’ve been through this already. There’s no other way. I am out of patience. She must know today. It’s okay if she denies. If she doesn’t deny, I’ll propose to her again afterwards” Lars turned into a child again. “Well, you can read a proposal song involving moments you had with her from my mobile. You don’t have to look at her.” Like Batman, there was no such thing as an unprepared Pie in those days. “Forget the song. Don’t be a wimp now, “F%##@&^¢“. You said you’re going to do it and you’ll do it”, fulminated Lars. “Let go of your ego; it is preventing you from facing a possibilities you’re not prepared for; let it go and you won’t need me to do it for you.” Pie was used to unleashing the ‘ego’ weapon whenever someone disagreed with him. It always worked with the logical ones. “Meh. Try another weapon. You said even Sophie and all her 7 hostel mates said it was a good idea. We have 8 votes against your 1” Lars shrugged it off. He was Pie’s alter-ego, after all. “1. She didn’t say that they thought it was a…","fields":{"slug":"/serait-ce-possible-alors/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-05-08","title":"A Vicarious Proposal"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Why parting ways seems inevitable More scale, more impact One way I define my purpose is to leave the 🌍 a tinsy bit better because I was here. There’s a room for experiencing new things, trying new🍦flavors, and breaking more bones while having adventures in this purpose but they are not the end, just the means 😎 This purpose is of course a myth, a fiction, an untruth, because the universe is not really going to care even if I magically become a superhuman and can control the 🌍 , but there’s a room for maximizing my good impact. If someone else can do what I want to do, I’d be equally happy. But I feel I can lend a hand, occasional hugs, and lotso love 😅 To meet that goal, I could: enter politics, apply lessons learned in leadership and shape policy on a grand scale. I don’t mind media digging out my past scandals or people making memes but it can be risky for my family. Quit job and create something (and not just stories 😄), like cardamom-avocado ice cream or some ML based startup but that’s again unstable. I’ll try this when I have enough capital to take big career risk again. Do what I’m doing but keep exploring. I feel the last option is appealing as it has the best chance to keep me sane and alive and not bankrupt 😅 Small steps, giant leaps while standing on shoulders of giants Other way I define my purpose is to advance knowledge of humankind a tiny step further. Research is probably the way to do it. I can do it if all of the following are true: I get transformed from being dumb to overnight genius actually know what I want to research somehow magically maintain interest beat the odds to get into good research environment can convincingly beg a bunch of rich idiots to fund my work every year do not fall in love with 32 students at once. Stats suggests that I’m less likely to be able to do this in abstract disciplines like Math or CS and more likely in observational/connectionist biological sciences at this age.\nI might get back to this purpose 5 years later if I have support of my family then😅 Engineer better Yet another way I define my purpose is to push the edge of technology slightly. This has a potential to save us (humans) from ourselves by automation (deliberately not calling it AI) This is appealing since it requires very little change in my status quo😜 but I’m certain my current team can definitely not help here 😞 Other aspect is fulfillment. That involves Learning. My current work-environment offers plenitude of this but it’d be…","fields":{"slug":"/spark-joy/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-08","title":"Where the Light Is"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"scenes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}
