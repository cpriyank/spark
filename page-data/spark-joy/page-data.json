There’s a room for experiencing new things, trying new🍦flavors, and breaking more bones while having adventures in this purpose but they are not the end, just the means 😎 This purpose is of course a myth, a fiction, an untruth, because the universe is not really going to care even if I magically become a superhuman and can control the 🌍 , but there’s a room for maximizing my good impact. If someone else can do what I want to do, I’d be equally happy. But I feel I can lend a hand, occasional hugs, and lotso love 😅 To meet that goal, I could: enter politics, apply lessons learned in leadership and shape policy on a grand scale. I don’t mind media digging out my past scandals or people making memes but it can be risky for my family. Quit job and create something (and not just stories 😄), like cardamom-avocado ice cream or some ML based startup but that’s again unstable. I’ll try this when I have enough capital to take big career risk again. Do what I’m doing but keep exploring. I feel the last option is appealing as it has the best chance to keep me sane and alive and not bankrupt 😅 Small steps, giant leaps while standing on shoulders of giants Other way I define my purpose is to advance knowledge of humankind a tiny step further. Research is probably the way to do it. I can do it if all of these are true: I get transformed from being dumb to overnight genius actually know what I want to research somehow magically maintain interest beat the odds to get into good research environment can convincingly beg a bunch of rich idiots to fund my work every year do not fall in love with 32 students at once. Stats suggests that I’m less likely to be able to do this in abstract disciplines like Math or CS and more likely in observational/connectionist biological sciences at this age.\nI might get back to this purpose 5 years later if I have support of my family then😅 Engineer better Yet another way I define my purpose is to push the edge of technology slightly. This has a potential to save us (humans) from ourselves by automation (deliberately not calling it AI) This is appealing since it requires very little change in my status quo😜 but I’m certain my current team can definitely not help here 😞 Other aspect is fulfillment. That involves Learning.

That involves</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning. My current work-environment offers plenitude of this but it’d be fantastic if I learn from my day-to-day work and from my peers.</li>\n<li>Boredom. When 18th century France was fraught with poverty and the church (which was kind of ruling France) thought of distributing money, Voltaire opposed and advocated to create more work opportunities instead: “Work saves us from three great evils: boredom, vice and need.” I can’t pretend to be excited when 70% of my work has become working config, making beautiful PPTs and creating colorful Excel sheets, and writing Ad-hoc database queries.</li>\n<li>Personal issues with engineering here: I have a strong aesthetic preference against things that feel slow, effortful, or inefficient. It pains me that it makes thousands of engineers like you and me unproductive by having to do manual, repetitive drudgery (this has been my experience with services and tools I use on daily basis, your experience may be better).</li>\n<li>Politics: it’s ugly in my team.</li>\n<li>💰: If I’m totally useless to the world, I can at least donate to meet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give?wprov=sfti1\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give?wprov=sfti1</a> . More 💰 will mean I can donate more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I still feel this doesn’t clearly express what I feel, but at least has broader visibility now😅</p>\n<hr>\n<p>PS.
